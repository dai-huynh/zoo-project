      The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is the largest rodent in the
      world. It is a member of the Caviidae family, which also includes guinea
      pigs and rock cavies. Capybaras are native to South America and are found
      in a variety of habitats, including savannas, dense forests, and wetlands.
      They are highly social animals and live in groups of 10-20 individuals.
      Capybaras are herbivores and primarily feed on grasses and aquatic plants.
