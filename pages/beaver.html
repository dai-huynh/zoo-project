      The beaver is a large, primarily nocturnal, semiaquatic rodent. It is the
      second-largest rodent in the world (after the capybara). Beavers are known
      for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are also known for
      their large, orange teeth. Beavers are found in North America and Europe.
