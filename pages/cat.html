      The domestic cat (Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous
      mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or
      simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids
      and felines. Cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability
      to hunt vermin such as mice. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various
      cat registries.
