      Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves,
      characterized by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of
      hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a
      strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size
      from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. They
      rank as the most diverse class of tetrapod vertebrates, with approximately
      ten thousand known living species.
